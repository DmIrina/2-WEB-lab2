                <li><strong>Wolf Leap:</strong> Andrius jumps into the air and leaps toward the ice circle that appears
                    on the ground.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Wolf Charge</strong>: After charging for a while, Andrius will quickly dash towards you,
                    leaving an ice trail in
                    his wake.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Wolf Slash</strong>: Andrius raises his front legs and slashes towards his front.</li>
                <li><strong>Tail Sweep</strong>:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Melee: Andrius raises his hind legs and sweeps his tail quickly.</li>
                    <li>Ranged: Andrius raises his hind legs and sweeps his tail quickly while shooting small icicles
                        towards
                        you.

                <li>
                    <strong>Spinning Slash</strong>: Andrius creates circular ice surfaces around him before spinning
                    quickly (The actual range of slash is wider in front of him than behind him).
                    This move is an unblockable attack and cannot be dodged by dashing.

                <li>
                    <strong>Repositioning</strong>: After attacking his hind legs, Andrius will reposition himself to
                    face
                    the player(s).
                </li>
